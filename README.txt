V0.4.2 is for testing.

To start generating the dungeon place one of the 4 'chamber spawner' nodes
underground and wait nearby for a minute.
Beware this structure can spread into previously generated world and can
destroy your builds, so set the X, Y, Z limits to contain generation.
To stop generation set mod parameter 'GEN = false'.
